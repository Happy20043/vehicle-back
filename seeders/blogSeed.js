          "2025 Toyota 4Runner Pricing: How Does It Compare To the Land Cruiser?",
        description:
          '<p>Despite some rather familiar looks, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2025-toyota-4runner-first-look-review/" target="_blank">Toyota 4Runner midsize SUV</a>&nbsp;is all-new for the 2025 model year, and pricing has just been announced. If you want a midsize off-road SUV package from Toyota but don&#39;t necessarily want a hybrid-only Land Cruiser, you have options in the 4Runner now that are as much as 15 grand more affordable! If you do want to swing for Toyota&#39;s admittedly good i-Force Max hybrid, which is optional in the 4Runner, will you still find a more affordable deal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short and quick answer is yes. The new hybrid i-Force Max 4Runner starts at $53,440, which is less than the current $56,450 starting price for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2025-toyota-land-cruiser-off-road-suv-pricing-msrp/" target="_blank">hybrid-only Land Cruiser&#39;s entry-level 1958 trim</a>. Both SUVs are based on the same platform with the same available hybrid powertrain, so really it comes down to the 4Runner&#39;s available optional third row of seating, versus the two-row-only, boxier heritage design appeal of the LC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><input alt="" src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/L3ky7R/s1/2025-toyota-4runner-vs-toyota-land-cruiser.webp" style="height:500px; width:889px" type="image" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><span style="font-size:26px"><strong>2025 Toyota 4Runner Prices</strong></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Trim Level</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>MSRP (dest. incl.)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner SR5 2WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$42,220</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner SR5 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$44,220</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Sport 2WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$48,700</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Sport 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$50,700</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$50,640</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road i-Force Max Hybrid 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$53,440</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Sport Premium 2WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$54,060</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Sport Premium 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$56,060</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Off-Road Premium i-Force Max Hybrid 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$59,220</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner Limited 2WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$56,850</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner Limited 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$58,850</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner Limited i-Force Max Hybrid 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$61,650</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner Platinum i-Force Max Hybrid 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$64,310</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner Trailhunter i-Force Max Hybrid 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$68,350</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Toyota 4Runner TRD Pro i-Force Max Hybrid 4WD</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">\r\n\t\t\t<p>$68,350</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notes about 4Runner pricing include the standard $2,000 upcharge for four-wheel drive (where it&#39;s optional over two-wheel drive), and we factor in the $1,450 destination fee.

        description:
          '<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2025-porsche-macan-macan-4s-first-drive-review/%3Fjk/" target="_blank">next-gen all-electric Porsche Macan SUV</a>&nbsp;is off to a strong start, but sales of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/taycan/" target="_blank">Taycan electric sedan</a>&nbsp;have slipped this year. That may have been enough cause for concern, along with a slower-than-expected growth in EV demand in these early years of mass EV adoption, for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/porsche/" target="_blank">Porsche</a>&nbsp;to now say it&#39;s considering gas versions of future vehicles, a shift from an all-EV plan previously promised. What does that mean for the 718, 911, and future three-row EV? Here&#39;s what to expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s the fresh quote, via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.autonews.com/volkswagen/porsche/ane-porsche-combustion-engine-evs-sales/" target="_blank">Auto News Europe</a>, from Porsche CFO Lutz Meschke: &ldquo;We are currently looking at the possibility of the originally planned all-electric vehicles having a hybrid drive or a combustion engine. We are currently in the middle of making conceptual decisions. What is clear is that we are sticking with the combustion engine for much longer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Porsche has already heavily invested in an all-electric 718 coupe and roadster replacement unless there&#39;s been a surprise, so don&#39;t expect the new car that shows up at the end of 2025 or 2026 to be anything but an EV. But that doesn&#39;t mean future updates couldn&#39;t spawn gas or more likely gas-hybrid versions if the market demands it and regulations allow it. Same thing with the current next-gen Macan EV. It would be impossible to expect a hybrid based on that platform overnight, but maybe a gas-hybrid Macan will return in the next few years in some form, on some platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/porsche-ev-plans-gas-hybrid-engines-future/photos/"><img alt="fourth gen Porsche Cayenne Electric EV SUV 1" src="https://www.motortrend.com/files/66a276334e2c72000895b60c/fourth-genporschecayenneelectricevsuv1.png?w=768&amp;width=768&amp;q=75&amp;format=webp" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s more certain concerns the already-announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/next-gen-porsche-cayenne-electric-suv-preview-teaser/" target="_blank">all-electric three-row Porsche SUV</a>, which is different from the three versions of the next-gen Cayenne we&#39;re also to expect according to Porsche back in July. The three-row codenamed-K1 SUV will be on a new platform in development; that could easily morph into an all-electric SUV with a gas-hybrid version of some sort, possibly an extended-range EV, or EREV. The next-gen Cayenne is already confirmed to come in three flavors, including gas, hybrid, and an all-electric setup, with the V-8 version of the SUV promised to stick around into the 2030s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 911 is now available as a hybrid, and the new 911 Turbo trim is expected to go hybrid as well. We don&#39;t really expect Porsche to go for a fully-electric 911, but maybe there&#39;s room for some other electrified supercar in the near future.</p>\r\n',

        title: "Indian Motorcycles: America's First Motorcycle",
        description:
          "<p>When you think of iconic American motorcycle brands, names like Harley-Davidson often come to mind. But long before Harley became a household name, there was another pioneer that blazed a trail in the motorcycle world: Indian Motorcycles. Founded in 1901, Indian Motorcycles holds the title of America&rsquo;s first motorcycle manufacturer and has a rich history that is deeply intertwined with the evolution of the motorcycle industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Birth of a Legend</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Motorcycles was established by George M. Hendee and Oscar Hedstrom in Springfield, Massachusetts. The duo initially focused on producing bicycles, but their passion for innovation led them to experiment with motorized bikes. Their breakthrough came in 1901 when they built their first prototype&mdash;a single-cylinder, 1.75 horsepower bike that they proudly dubbed the &quot;Indian.&quot; The name was a nod to the brand&#39;s American heritage and the Native American imagery that would become synonymous with the brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Early Success and Innovation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Motorcycles quickly gained a reputation for quality and performance. In 1903, Indian introduced its first production model, the &quot;Indian Single,&quot; which featured a 2.5 horsepower engine and a belt drive. This model set the stage for future innovations and established Indian as a leading player in the motorcycle industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Indian&#39;s notable achievements in the early years was its success in racing. Indian bikes dominated the racing circuit, with the brand winning its first race in 1901 and continuing to win numerous races throughout the 1910s and 1920s. Indian&#39;s dedication to performance and reliability was evident, and its bikes became a favorite among riders and racers alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Great War and Beyond</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The onset of World War I marked a significant chapter in Indian Motorcycles&#39; history. The U.S. Army sought reliable and durable motorcycles for reconnaissance and communication, and Indian answered the call. During the war, Indian supplied thousands of bikes to the military, proving the brand&rsquo;s robustness and reliability on a global stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post-war, Indian Motorcycles continued to innovate, introducing several groundbreaking models such as the Chief, Scout, and Roadmaster. These models featured larger engines, improved suspension, and more advanced features, further cementing Indian&rsquo;s reputation as a leading motorcycle manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Challenges and Transformation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its early successes, Indian Motorcycles faced numerous challenges over the years. The Great Depression, World War II, and changing consumer preferences all took a toll on the company. In the 1950s and 1960s, Indian struggled with financial difficulties and management issues, which ultimately led to the company&rsquo;s closure in 1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian brand was resurrected several times, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the early 2000s that the brand experienced a significant revival. In 2011, Indian Motorcycles was acquired by Polaris Industries, the manufacturer of Victory Motorcycles. Under Polaris&rsquo;s ownership, Indian was reintroduced with modern designs that honored its classic heritage while incorporating contemporary technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Modern Era and Legacy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Indian Motorcycles stands as a testament to its rich history and enduring legacy. The brand&rsquo;s modern lineup includes models like the Scout, Chief, and Challenger, which blend vintage aesthetics with state-of-the-art performance. Indian continues to honor its heritage while embracing innovation, ensuring that it remains a relevant and respected name in the motorcycle world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Motorcycles&#39; legacy is not just about the machines it has produced but also about the spirit of innovation and excellence that it represents. From its humble beginnings in a small Springfield workshop to its place as a global motorcycle icon, Indian has shown that it&rsquo;s not just about the ride but about the journey and the history that makes it legendary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian Motorcycles holds a unique place in the annals of motorcycle history as America&rsquo;s first motorcycle manufacturer. Its journey from pioneering innovations to overcoming challenges and its revival in the modern era reflect a brand that has consistently pushed the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible in motorcycling. As Indian continues to ride into the future, it carries with it a legacy of craftsmanship, performance, and an indomitable spirit that has defined American motorcycling for over a century.</p>\r\n",

        description:
          '<p>The Porsche 911 is more than just a car; it is an automotive legend. For over 60 years, this iconic sports car has captured the hearts of enthusiasts, combining sophisticated design with unparalleled performance. First introduced in 1964, the 911 was revolutionary for its time and quickly set the standard for luxury sports cars. Its rear-engine configuration and sleek silhouette remain central to its identity, and through generations, the 911 has continually evolved while retaining the qualities that made it a classic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the very beginning, Porsche&rsquo;s engineers designed the 911 to be a perfect blend of performance, comfort, and everyday usability. It was a car that could be driven to the office and raced on the track without missing a beat. This versatility, paired with a commitment to cutting-edge technology, has helped the 911 maintain its reputation as one of the most well-rounded and exciting sports cars ever built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 911&rsquo;s performance is nothing short of extraordinary. Whether it&#39;s the naturally aspirated engines of the past or the turbocharged powertrains of the current models, each iteration offers a thrilling driving experience. Precision handling, blistering acceleration, and an unmistakable exhaust note make driving a 911 a visceral, unforgettable experience. The car&#39;s engineering excellence is evident in its impeccable handling, thanks to its rear-engine layout and the near-perfect balance achieved in every model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Porsche 911 has an undeniable presence on the road. Its design is instantly recognizable, with a smooth, aerodynamic shape that has become a symbol of automotive elegance. Despite numerous design updates, the core essence of the 911 remains unchanged, with its round headlights and curvaceous rear maintaining a timeless appeal that still stands out today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="" src="https://i.gaw.to/vehicles/photos/40/25/402523-2021-porsche-911.jpg" style="height:500px; width:800px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Motorsport has always played a significant role in the development of the Porsche 911. The car&rsquo;s history is intertwined with countless racing victories, from endurance races like Le Mans to the grueling Rally championships. Porsche&#39;s dedication to motorsport has influenced the 911&rsquo;s design, enhancing its performance on both the track and the street. It&rsquo;s this racing heritage that continues to inspire future generations of 911 models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the 911 has progressed, so too has its technology. Today&rsquo;s models are equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, hybrid technology, and infotainment features that make the 911 more accessible and practical without compromising its performance. With every new release, Porsche pushes the boundaries of automotive innovation, ensuring that the 911 remains on the cutting edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Porsche 911 is also a testament to quality craftsmanship.

Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned collector or a first-time buyer, the 911 offers an unparalleled driving experience that makes it much more than just a car&mdash;it&rsquo;s an expression of pure automotive passion.</p>\r\n',

        description:
          '<p>Audi has officially opened order books for the highly anticipated Audi A6 E-Tron, with pricing starting from &pound;69,900 for the saloon and &pound;71,700 for the estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Audi A6 Goes Fully Electric</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="New audi a6 e tron" src="https://www.modifiedrides.net/medias/images/new-audi-a6-e-tron.webp" style="height:596px; width:900px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a bold move, Audi has decided to make the A6 a fully electric vehicle (EV), retiring the petrol and diesel versions of the A6. These traditional variants will be rebranded under the A7 name for the next generation, expected to launch next year. This marks a significant step in Audi&rsquo;s shift towards electric mobility, positioning the A6 E-Tron as a trailblazer in the executive EV segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Sleek Design with Production-Ready Enhancements</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="New audi a6 e tron 5" src="https://www.modifiedrides.net/medias/images/new-audi-a6-e-tron-5.webp" style="height:596px; width:900px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Audi A6 E-Tron closely mirrors the concept first revealed three years ago, maintaining its sleek and muscular design. While there have been minor adjustments for production, including larger air intakes, full-size headlights, and additional ADAS sensors, the A6 retains its modern and elegant proportions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Premium Platform Electric (PPE) Architecture</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The A6 E-Tron is built on Audi&rsquo;s advanced Premium Platform Electric (PPE), the same architecture used for the Q6 E-Tron. This platform supports 800V electrics, enabling faster charging and accommodating various battery sizes and powertrains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Impressive Range and Performance</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audi has equipped the A6 E-Tron with a new 94.9kWh battery, providing the Sportback version with a remarkable 463-mile range, surpassing competitors like the BMW i5 (356 miles) and Mercedes EQE (429 miles). The Avant estate version offers a slightly lower range of 437 miles, due to its less aerodynamic shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Battery and Charging Capabilities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The A6 E-Tron features an innovative lithium-ion battery with nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry, delivering a 30% improvement in energy density compared to older models like the Q8 E-Tron. Audi will also introduce a smaller 79kWh battery shortly after the launch, catering to drivers seeking different range options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to charging, the A6 E-Tron supports 11kW AC charging through two ports located on either side of the car. The driver&rsquo;s side port can handle up to 270kW of DC fast charging, enabling quick top-ups. An upgrade to 22kW AC charging is also expected later in the car&rsquo;s life cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Powertrain Options: Performance and S6 Models</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two powertrain options will be available at launch:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performance model: Powered by a rear-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor, it delivers 362bhp, allowing the A6 to sprint from 0-62mph in 5.4 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S6 model: Priced from &pound;97,500, the S6 adds an asynchronous motor on the front axle, giving it four-wheel drive and a total output of 496bhp. In boost mode, power is temporarily increased to 543bhp, shaving the 0-62mph time down to 3.9 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top speed is limited to 130mph for the Performance model and 149mph for the S6. The S6 offers a range of 406 miles for the saloon and 388 miles for the estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>RS6 E-Tron Coming Soon</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audi has also confirmed that the RS6 will be reimagined as a pure electric vehicle, offering even higher performance than the current 621bhp V8 model. This high-performance version will further expand Audi&rsquo;s electric portfolio, appealing to performance enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Enhanced Driving Comfort and Advanced Features</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="New audi a6 e tron 4" src="https://www.modifiedrides.net/medias/images/new-audi-a6-e-tron-4.webp" style="height:596px; width:900px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new A6 E-Tron promises exceptional comfort, with adaptive air suspension available on the S6 model for a smoother ride. High-end models can adjust their ride height on the go to optimize aerodynamics and improve range. When parked, the suspension lifts to make entry easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside, the cabin mirrors the design of the new Audi A5 and Q6 E-Tron, featuring a large, high-resolution OLED screen as the central focal point. This display is divided into an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.5-inch infotainment touchscreen. For added convenience, a 10.9-inch passenger display is available as an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>UK Deliveries Begin February 2024</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first deliveries of the Audi A6 E-Tron in the UK are expected to commence in February 2024, marking the arrival of Audi&rsquo;s latest innovation in the luxury electric car market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="New audi a6 e tron" src="https://www.modifiedrides.net/medias/images/new-audi-a6-e-tron.webp" style="height:596px; width:900px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a bold move, Audi has decided to make the A6 a fully electric vehicle (EV), retiring the petrol and diesel versions of the A6.
